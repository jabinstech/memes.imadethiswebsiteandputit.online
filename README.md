meme website for imadethiswebsiteandputit.online
## why
well, i needed to make a memes section for imadethiswebsiteandputit.online and i sure as a totino's pizza roll wasn't going to copy each individual image and paste each one into a canva design which is limited to 7,000 pixels per page anyway so if i just copy the image links from cleanmemes.com (thanks) and paste it into markdown i can do a lot at a time and it's efficient and i can feel useful when i'm just looking through a meme website for the most funny memes.
